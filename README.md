PHP travelport-uapi-tutorial-php
This PHP tutorial provides the building blocks for coding a flight, hotel, and vehicle booking application in Travelport Universal API. It teaches you how to setup and configure Travelport Universal API and how to send basic requests. You will learn how to:

Request Air schedules, availability, and pricing, and book flights.
Request Hotel and Vehicle availability and pricing, request vehicle types, and book a hotel and vehicle.
You can read the tutorial online via Github or you can clone the repository and examine the branch 'gh-pages'.

If you have questions or comments, please post them to the issue tracker in Github.

If you are experienced with WSDL and C#, we would love to see a port of this code to C# for those more familiar with Windows development. You can submit this port to us with a pull request.
